# Astro-Schole: A Contemplative Reading Interface

This project is a take-home challenge to create an immersive digital reading experience inspired by the principles of Schol√©, or "leisurely learning." The goal is to design an interface that encourages deep, contemplative engagement with content through thoughtful design and subtle micro-animations.

## Key Features

- **Contemplative Design:** The layout is clean and spacious, minimizing distractions to create a focused reading environment. It features generous whitespace and an elegant, classical feel.
- **Responsive and Accessible:** Built with a mobile-first approach, the interface ensures a seamless reading experience on all devices. It uses semantic HTML and is designed with accessibility in mind.
- **Subtle Micro-Animations:** The project includes purposeful animations that serve the user, not distract them.
- **Scroll-triggered reveals:** Content gently fades into view as the user scrolls, guiding their attention.
- **Progressive disclosure:** Supplementary content can be expanded or collapsed smoothly.

## Technical Stack

- **Framework:** Astro for a modern, performance-focused static site.
- **Styling:** Modern CSS with Flexbox, Grid, and Custom Properties.
- **Functionality:** Intersection Observer for scroll-triggered animations.
